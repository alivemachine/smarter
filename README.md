## 📍 Overview

The project provides an HTML webpage that leverages the CABLES.js library to visualize a custom patch. The webpage allows for customization and optimization of the patch through provided functions and event listeners. Its value lies in offering a platform to create and display interactive visualizations, adding a visually dynamic element to webpages. The code is released under the MIT License, enabling widespread usage and modification.

## ⚙️ Features

| Feature                | Description                                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **⚙️ Architecture**     | The system follows a client-server architecture with an HTML webpage as the client and a backend server. |                                  |
| **🔗 Dependencies**    | Relies on the CABLES.js library and possibly other external libraries.                                    |
| **🧩 Modularity**      | The codebase organizes the system into separate files for different components.                          |
| **🔀 Version Control** | Git is used for version control.                                                                         |
| **🔌 Integrations**    | Integrates with the CABLES.js library for visual patch generation.                                        |                                                           |

Please note that several categories lack information in the codebase, such as testing, performance, security, and scalability. It is essential to gather additional information or analyze the codebase further to have a more comprehensive understanding of these aspects.
